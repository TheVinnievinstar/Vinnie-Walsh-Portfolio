      <p>
        I am a hard-working, motivated and reliable individual with excellent timekeeping skills. Prone to learn new skills, I am always challenging myself to do better and complete every task above standards.<br><br>I am self-taught in Web and Software Development, learning from repeatable companies such as Codecademy and ITCareerSwitch courses. From these courses I have learnt the fundamental of creating a website and software using coding languages such as PHP, Python, JavaScript and many more. I am also self-taught in a multitude of visual effects and animation programs.

          As much as I enjoyed creating gaming videos, I wanted to improve on visual effects thus, I started learning how to animate using Cinema 4D and Adobe After Effects for the visual effects.<br><br> Eventually, I started a new channel to advertise my work. I started gaining clients and a following with one channel at almost 1000 subscribers on a YouTube channel and over 500 subscribers on another that I used to showcase to a college.

          Having an interest in developing websites and coding but never trying it I finally threw myself into a course to learn the fundamental of full-stack development. This taught me commonly used languages used to create websites, programs and servers.<br>After doing the course it helped me decide this is what I want as a career.
