            Intros<br>“Intros” are short animated sequences used to present a name, business or anything the client wants showcased.<br>The style you will see on my channels was the most commonly created called Text Intros. The text intros ranged from 3D animated logos/text, 2D animated logos/text and Minecraft animations which will also have text and logo animated into the scene.<br><br>It was more than just an introduction for clients, it had a cult following. A lot of channels collaborated, contest, made giveaways for anyone to enter and others made templates. The list goes on and even one channel making over 100k subscribers.<br><br>The text intros are not considered industry standard by any means (by myself), more for people that made gaming content for fun and wanted “hype” at the start of their videos. I have made over 800 during the 3 years I was making them, it taught me how to sell them, the different types of animation styles and so much more.<br>Created with:<br>Maxon Cinema 4D<br>Auto Desk Maya<br>Blender<br>Adobe After Effects<br>Adobe Illustrator<br>Adobe Media Encoder

            First Year FMP By Vinnie W. & Dylan R-Kelly<br>This was my first year's Final Major Project, it was joint project. The idea for this was to use what we had learned in the first year to make an animated scene. The story for the animation was a rocket flying through a street into a building at the end.<br>Due to time we were unfortunately unable to render the scenes properly, so we improvised and I used the plugins I had installed on my own computer to make the scene not look so dull.<br>Created with:<br>Auto Desk Maya<br>Adobe After Effects<br>Adobe Media Encoder
